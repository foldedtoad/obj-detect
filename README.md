# obj-detect
Realtime Object Detection using the Movidius NCS dongle on Raspberry Pi.

In the obj-det.py module, look for the comment '# robin',  this is where I have made changes.
Most notable is the setting of the IP address to the IP Camera: circa line 131 or so.
Also there is a change to resize the image to not consume the whole screen.
